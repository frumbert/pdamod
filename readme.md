# PDAcademy Mod

This plugin is a Wordpress integration for the PDAcademy to extend the functionality of Edwiser Bridge and WooCommerce to display courses that have been enrolled through Moodle on the my-courses page, which normally only lists the courses purchased through WooCommerce.

It also contains a shortcode which can enrol a user through the https://github.com/frumbert/local_signuptoken web service, which in turn relies on https://github.com/frumbert/enrol-token.

It requires the URL of the Moodle site, and the webservice access token.
